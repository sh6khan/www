<h2>Money-Converter</h2>

    <p>When working with systems that heavily depend on FX rates from Yahoo, I realized that if Yahoo had a problem, then my system would break. Money-Converter is a fault tolerant library that looks at many sources and intelligently picks the most accurate rate. It's documented, tested, easy to use, and open source.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Process-Lock</h2>
    
    <p>Process-Lock is a fully featured and reliable locking system which ensures that only one instance of your service is opperating at a time. It's used at Coinbase for core services at Coinbase</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>Open Source</h2>
    <p>I love contributing to open source. Money-Converter and Process-Lock are just two examples. They were solutions to real problems and shared with everyone else. Open source is what makes this industry so amazing and I encourage everyone to join</p>

    <p>My open source contributions come in the form of more than just Libraries, I have in-depth guides on popular technologies such as Ruby On Rails and Git. I am an offical contributer to Ruby on Rails and have contributed to other popular repositories such as the Ruby guide by Airbnb</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2>DBMapper</h2>
    <p>As an app gets more and more complicated as does your database. You start having too many joins and complex traversals which are very difficult to visualize. Dbmapper is a simple Ruby Gem that helps you see the relationships of all your database tables and information.</p>
